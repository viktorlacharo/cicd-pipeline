To summarize what we've implemented:

Zustand store with localStorage persistence (useCartStore.ts):

Optimistic local state updates
Persistance to localStorage
Server sync functionality
Shopping cart hooks:

useShoppingCart.ts: Core cart functionality with debounced server syncing
useCart.ts: Simplified hook for product-specific cart actions
Components:

ShoppingCartButton: Cart icon with badge showing item count
ShoppingCartDrawer: Slide-in drawer for quick cart viewing
AddToCartButton: Button to add products to cart
CartItem: Individual cart item component
CartSummary: Summary of cart totals
CartPage: Full cart page
CheckoutClientPage: Checkout form
API Routes:

GET /api/cart: Fetches server-side cart
POST /api/cart/sync: Syncs client cart with server
App Pages:

/cart: Full cart page
/checkout: Checkout page
This implementation follows the hybrid approach you described:

Optimistic local updates with Zustand
localStorage persistence
Debounced server sync
Client-wins merge strategy (can be customized)
Server-side cart validation
